# CHATGPT_Speaking_Version
This is a Speaking version of CHATGPT using the CHATGPT API. It takes voice input and returns voice output as well as text.
To run this, I use "Spyder (Python 3.9)" version here.
Before execute this program we need some library 
1. pyttsx3
2. speech_recognition as sr
3. openai
4. pyaudio
   here are the command to install those library
    1. "pip install pyttsx3"
    2. "pip install SpeechRecognition" or "python -m speech_recognition"
    3. "pip install openai"
    4. "pip install pyaudio" 
After this, you have to create a ChatGPT account to get your API key. After obtaining your API key, put that API KEY on the 10th line of your program.
Now you can run your program.
